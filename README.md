This is my submission for the Module 6 Lesson 3 Assignment. 

In this flask app, there is a modified structure for the 'Fitness Center' database, using flask-sqlalchemy and ORM methods. 

From the list of methods, there are routes that call for methods to:
- Retrieve all members from the members table
- Add a new member
- Update a members information
- Delete a member 
- Retrieve all workout sessions from the sessions table 
- Schedule a new workout session
- Update and existing workout session
- Retrieve all workout sessions for a specific member
- Delete a workout session

For testing purposes, the password to access the database was written under a seperate 'password' module, so a password or other module may need to be entered in. 

Also for testing purposes, the table names under the code were written as the table names in my own database.

Thank you!
